# ember-cli-imgix

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/imgix/ember-cli-imgix.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/imgix/ember-cli-imgix)

An Ember addon for easily adding responsive imagery via [imgix](https://www.imgix.com) to your application.

**Note:** Front-end imgix libraries and framework integrations will not work with imgix Web Proxy Sources. They will only work with imgix Web Folder or S3 Sources.

## Installation

From within an existing ember-cli project:

```bash
$ ember install ember-cli-imgix
```

Next, set up some configuration flags:

```javascript
// config/environment.js

module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    // snip
    APP: {
      imgix: {
        source: 'my-social-network.imgix.net',
        debug: true // Prints out diagnostic information on the image itself. Turn off in production.
      }
    }
    // snip
  }
};
```

## Usage

`ember-cli-imgix` exposes a new image container that works will for creating responsive images. It is a `<div>` element with a single
`<img>` child element. Adding them to your templates is quite easy:

```hbs
{{imgix-image path="/users/1.png"}}
```

The HTML generated by this might look like the following:

```html
<div>
  <img src="https://my-social-network.com/users/1.png?w=400&h=300&dpr=1" />
</div>
```

The `src` attribute will have [imgix URL API parameters](https://www.imgix.com/docs/reference) added to it to perform the resize.

### LQIP

To use low quality image placeholders, pass LQIP true to the component. Currently the LQIP values are hardcoded, if you need some other LQIP behavior open a PR. 

### imgix-image-element

For an unwrapped `<img>` element, use the `{{imgix-image-element}}` component. This component can also accept an `aspectRatio` parameter:

```hbs
{{imgix-image-element path="/users/1.png" crossorigin="anonymous" aspectRatio=1.33}}
```

This will maintain the same aspect ratio as the image is resized.

Please see the [dummy app](./tests/dummy) for insight into setting this up and configuring this.

## Running a test app

To see this in action with some stock photos, clone this repo and then run `ember serve`

git clone git@github.com:imgix/ember-cli-imgix.git
cd ember-cli-imgix
ember serve
```
